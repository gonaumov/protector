# Protection of disabling selection of text on a web page

A friend of mine asked me to do something because many sites are blocking 
selection of text and he is used to select the text in order to have a 
mark how far he has come in reading. I created that user script and tested
it on very well protected site. Frankly I would never visit a site 
which make things like that. You can use that script from TamperMonkey 
and GreaseMonkey.
